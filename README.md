# Geckos-Team-02: Church of Brunch
We endeavor to create a public service that allows visitors to search for and find brunch services in their area.

Chingu Voyage-6 | https://chingu.io/

# About / Synopsis

* Project status: prototype
Our service will allow individuals to take the following actions:

* Search for restaurants in their city (or any city) that offer a brunch menu for Saturday and/or Sunday.
* We will use Google Places (GPlaces) and Google Maps (GMaps) to allow searching by location convenient and easy for the user.
* Additionally value added features will be done in this order initially:
* Filtering results based on proximity
* Filtering results by service rating
* Indicate the availability or need for a reservation and then a click through to that service.
* FIltering service by type: Buffet or A la carte.
